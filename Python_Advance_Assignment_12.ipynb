    "In Python, strings are made immutable so that programmers cannot alter the contents of the object (even by mistake). This avoids unnecessary bugs. we can assign a value to a string's indexed character it doesn't violate Python's string immutability because for ding that we first have to split the string word into characters which leaves us with simple character string we can replace it easily with some other character but still it will be string even if the replaced value will be an interger or floting number or anything."
